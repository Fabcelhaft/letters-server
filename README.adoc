= Letters server

Goal of the letters server is to enable anonymous feedback within a team.

So first step is to configure persistence and a mail server.

Then one need to create a csv file with names and mails for user initialization:

[source, csv]
----
Max Mustermann;max.mustermann@example.com
Marie Musterfrau;marie.musterfrau@example.com
----

Default it is located `/users.csv`

While server start these users get created, as long as they don't already exist.

For each user a key-pair with a password is generated. Public and private Key are stored in the configured database. The password is sent via mail. The password is *never* persisted.
